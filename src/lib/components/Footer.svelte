    The application of Correspondence Analysis to the smartvote Voting Advice Application
    demonstrates the power of dimensionality reduction techniques in making complex political data
    more interpretable. By transforming high-dimensional survey responses into a lower-dimensional
    space, we were able to uncover meaningful patterns in voters' political preferences and their
    relationships to party positions.

  <p class="my-4">
    The process involved careful data preparation, application of CA to the contingency tables of
    response patterns, and interpretation of the resulting dimensions through both statistical
    metrics and domain knowledge of Swiss political dynamics. While some nuances may be lost in the
    dimensionality reduction, the benefits of visualization and simplified interpretation make CA a
    valuable tool for both researchers and Voting Application Advice developers.

    I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Fynn Bachmann for their invaluable guidance
    throughout this research and also Smartvote for providing the resources for the data.
